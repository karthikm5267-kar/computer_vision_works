# Wavelet-Based Multi-Resolution Image Analysis & Feature Extraction

This project implements **Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA)** of grayscale images using **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** and extracts **statistical texture features** from the wavelet sub-bands.

The system decomposes an image into multiple frequency components and computes energy-, entropy-, and dispersion-based features useful for **image analysis, texture classification, and computer vision applications**.
