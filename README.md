# Image Object Segmentation & Transformation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **image processing pipeline** that performs:
- Object detection and segmentation
- Extraction of individual objects
- Geometric transformations on each detected object

The implementation is designed to run seamlessly on **Google Colab** using OpenCV and Python.
